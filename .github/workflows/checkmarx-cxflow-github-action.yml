# This is a basic workflow to create GitHub Issues using the Checkmarx CxFlow GitHub Action.  It runs on a push to the main branch.
#
# The following GitHub Secrets must be first defined:
#   - CHECKMARX_URL
#   - CHECKMARX_USER
#   - CHECKMARX_PASSWORD
#   - CHECKMARX_CLIENT_SECRET
#   - GH_TOKEN
#
# Update the 'team' field to reflect the team name used in Checkmarx.

# For full documentation,including a list of all inputs, please refer to the README https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/checkmarx-cxflow-github-action
